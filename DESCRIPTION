Title: NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen) Lightweight Messaging Library
Version: 0.10.2
Description: R binding for NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen), a successor to ZeroMQ. NNG is 
    a socket library providing high-performance scalability protocols, a
    cross-platform standard for messaging and communications. Serves as a
    concurrency framework for building distributed applications, utilising 'aio'
    objects which resolve automatically upon completion of asynchronous
    operations. Implements connections with transport layer security, and
    synchronisation primitives, which allow R execution to wait upon events
    being signalled by concurrent messaging threads.
