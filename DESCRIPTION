Title: NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen) Lightweight Messaging Library
Version: 0.6.0
Description: R binding for NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen), a successor to ZeroMQ. NNG is 
    a socket library providing high-performance scalability protocols,
    implementing a cross-platform standard for messaging and communications.
    Serves as a concurrency framework for building distributed applications,
    utilising 'Aio' objects which automatically resolve upon completion of
    asynchronous operations.
