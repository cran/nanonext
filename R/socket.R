# nanonext - Core - Sockets ----------------------------------------------------

#' Open Socket
#'
#' Open a Socket implementing 'protocol', and optionally dial (establish an
#'     outgoing connection) or listen (accept an incoming connection) at an
#'     address.
#'
#' @param protocol [default 'bus'] choose protocol - 'bus', 'pair', 'push',
#'     'pull', 'pub', 'sub', 'req', 'rep', 'surveyor', or 'respondent' - see
#'     \link{protocols}.
#' @param dial (optional) a URL to dial, specifying the transport and address as
#'     a character string e.g. 'inproc://anyvalue' or 'tcp://127.0.0.1:5555'
#'     (see \link{transports}).
#' @param listen (optional) a URL to listen at, specifying the transport and
#'     address as a character string e.g. 'inproc://anyvalue' or
#'     'tcp://127.0.0.1:5555' (see \link{transports}).
#' @param autostart [default TRUE] whether to start the dialer/listener. Set to
#'     FALSE if setting configuration options on the dialer/listener as it is
#'     not generally possible to change these once started. For dialers only:
#'     set to NA to start synchronously - this is less resilient if a
#'     connection is not immediately possible, but avoids subtle errors from
#'     attempting to use the socket before an asynchronous dial has completed.
#' @param raw [default FALSE] whether to open raw mode sockets. Note: not for
#'     general use - do not enable unless you have a specific need, such as for
#'     use with \code{\link{device}} (refer to NNG documentation).
#'
#' @return A Socket (object of class 'nanoSocket' and 'nano').
#'
#' @details NNG presents a socket view of networking. The sockets are constructed
#'     using protocol-specific functions, as a given socket implements precisely
#'     one protocol.
#'
#'     Each socket may be used to send and receive messages (if the protocol
#'     supports it, and implements the appropriate protocol semantics). For
#'     example, sub sockets automatically filter incoming messages to discard
#'     those for topics that have not been subscribed.
#'
#'     This function (optionally) binds a single Dialer and/or Listener to a Socket.
#'     More complex network topologies may be created by binding further
#'     Dialers/Listeners to the Socket as required using \code{\link{dial}} and
#'     \code{\link{listen}}. New contexts can also be created using
#'     \code{\link{context}} if the protocol supports it.
#'
#' @section Protocols:
#'
#'     The following Scalability Protocols (communication patterns) are implemented:
#'     \itemize{
#'     \item{Bus (mesh networks) - protocol: 'bus'}
#'     \item{Pair (two-way radio) - protocol: 'pair'}
#'     \item{Pipeline (one-way pipe) - protocol: 'push', 'pull'}
#'     \item{Publisher/Subscriber (topics & broadcast) - protocol: 'pub', 'sub'}
#'     \item{Request/Reply (RPC) - protocol: 'req', 'rep'}
#'     \item{Survey (voting & service discovery) - protocol: 'surveyor', 'respondent'}
#'     }
#'
#'     Please see \link{protocols} for further documentation.
#'
#' @examples
#' socket <- socket("pair")
#' socket
#' close(socket)
#'
#' @export

                   listen = NULL,
                   autostart = TRUE,
                   raw = FALSE) {

  sock <- .Call(rnng_protocol_open, protocol, raw)

#' Close Connection
#'
#' Close Connection on a Socket, Context, Dialer, Listener, Stream, Pipe or
#'     ncurl Session.
#'
#' @param con a Socket, Context, Dialer, Listener, Stream, Pipe or 'ncurlSession'.
#' @param ... not used.
#'
#' @return Invisibly, an integer exit code (zero on success).
#'
#' @details Closing an object explicitly frees its resources. An object can also
#'     be removed directly in which case its resources are freed when the object
#'     is garbage collected.
#'
#'     Closing a Socket associated with a Context also closes the Context.
#'
#'     Dialers and Listeners are implicitly closed when the Socket they are
#'     associated with is closed.
#'
#'     Pipes are automatically closed when their creator closes, or when the
#'     remote peer closes the underlying connection.
#'
#'     Closing a Socket or a Context: messages that have been submitted for
#'     sending may be flushed or delivered, depending upon the transport. Closing
#'     the Socket while data is in transmission will likely lead to loss of that
#'     data. There is no automatic linger or flush to ensure that the Socket
#'     send buffers have completely transmitted.
#'
#'     Closing a Stream: if any send or receive operations are pending, they
#'     will be terminated and any new operations will fail after the connection
#'     is closed.
#'
#'     Closing a pipe: messages that have been submitted for sending may be
#'     flushed or delivered, depending upon the transport.
